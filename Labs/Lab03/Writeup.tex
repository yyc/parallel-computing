\subsection{Exercise 3}
The Dell Inspiron runs with a higher CPI than the Dell Optiplex, possibly due to different instruction sets.
IPC and MFLOPS increases with the number of threads up to the number of cores, so 4 in the case of the Inspiron and 8 in the case of the Optiplex, because they contain 4 and 8 cores respectively
